# Link Access Control Website

A frontend-based link access control website that simulates a gated access flow using QR payment confirmation, email verification, and access codes.  
The project demonstrates controlled user flow, conditional navigation, and client-side validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔐 Access Flow Overview

1. User scans a QR code to complete payment (simulation)
2. User receives an access code
3. User verifies their email using a verification code
4. Upon successful verification, the protected link is unlocked
5. Unauthorized users are blocked from accessing the link

This project is a **frontend-only prototype**.  
All validations are handled on the client side and are intended for **demonstration and learning purposes only**.  
No real payment verification or secure authentication is implemented.

## Brutally honest advice (don’t skip)

- ❌ This is **NOT production-ready**
- ❌ Anyone can bypass it using DevTools
- ✅ Still acceptable as a **flow prototype**
- ✅ Safe for portfolio **if you’re honest**

### If you want this to be real:
You’ll need:
- Backend (Node/PHP)
- Database
- Payment gateway API
- Email service API
- Server-side validation

If you want next, I can:
- Upgrade this to a **real backend architecture**
- Convert it into a **secure system design document**
- Help you explain this safely in interviews

Say the word.
